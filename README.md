 ###  Domain: Human Resources (HR)

# Analysis Details
 ## i. HR Case
 
##### 🚩 Problem Statement:

The company is experiencing inconsistent attrition trends across departments, age groups, tenure levels, and education categories, raising concerns about employee engagement, workforce stability, and long-term HR planning effectiveness.

##### Key Issues:

► What factors are driving the high attrition rate among younger employees, particularly those aged 25–34?

► Why are specific departments such as Sales and R&D consistently experiencing higher turnover than others?

► What causes newly hired employees (0–2 years of tenure) to leave at a significantly higher rate than long-tenured staff?

► How do attrition patterns differ across education levels, and which groups are most at risk of leaving?

► What role does job satisfaction play in voluntary exits, and which roles or levels show the lowest engagement?

► How is the loss of skilled employees affecting the company’s productivity, operational stability, and replacement costs?

 ## iv. 🔍 Insights and Recommendations
 
### Overall Workforce Metrics

 ● Total employees = 1470, of which 237 left → Attrition Rate: 16.12%.

 ● Active employees = 1233, indicating a moderate turnover level.

 ● Average employee age is 37, meaning a mid-career workforce.

### Department-wise Insights

 ● R&D and Sales show the highest attrition (largest slices in the pie chart).

 ● HR has the smallest attrition share, indicating higher job stability.

### Age Group Trends

 ● Age group 25–34 has the highest employee count.

 ● Workers aged 35–44 also form a strong portion of the workforce.

 ● Attrition is highest among under 25 and 25–34 age groups.

### Gender Trends

 ● In almost every age group, male attrition slightly exceeds female attrition.

 ● Under 25: Female attrition proportionally higher than male.

 ● Above 55: Very low attrition for both genders.

### Education-wise

 ● Attrition is highest among employees with Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees (largest bars).

 ● High school and technical education groups show low attrition volume.

### Job Satisfaction

 ● Some roles (e.g., Sales Representative, Laboratory Technicians) have many low satisfaction ratings (1–2).

 ● Higher-level managerial roles show relatively better satisfaction.

## 📈 Recommendations

 ✓ Target retention programs for 25–34 age group, where most attrition occurs.

 ✓ Improve satisfaction for Sales & R&D roles, as they show the biggest attrition.

 ✓ Launch career-growth and skill-development programs for bachelor/associate degree groups.

 ✓ Conduct focused exit-interviews to understand dissatisfaction among low-satisfaction roles (lab techs, sales reps).

 ✓ Introduce gender-inclusive engagement strategies, addressing slightly higher male attrition.
   
 ## v. Data Source
 
 [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)


# A - Analysis Techniques:
## A1 - Data Preparation

### Data Collection & Inspection

The HR dataset was collected from [source] and contains employee demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition information. Initial inspection included checking the number of rows and columns, data types, and summary statistics to identify anomalies or inconsistencies. Duplicate entries and obvious errors were removed, and categorical columns were standardized to ensure consistency.

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Missing values were addressed using appropriate strategies, such as median imputation for numerical fields and mode or “Unknown” labels for categorical fields. Outliers were detected via boxplots and Z-score methods and were either capped or removed to prevent skewed analysis. New features were created to enhance insights, including age groups, experience levels, and work-life balance scores. Categorical variables were encoded for analysis and modeling, with one-hot encoding for nominal data and label encoding for ordinal data.

### Data Transformation & Final Dataset

Numerical features were normalized or standardized to improve model performance and ensure consistency across visualizations. Units and date formats were unified for clarity in dashboards. The cleaned dataset was split into features and target variable (Attrition) and saved as HR_Attrition_Cleaned.csv for use in dashboard visualizations and predictive modeling. A data dictionary was also prepared to describe each column and its role in analysis.

# B - DAX (Data Analysis Expression)
   ### KPI Measures
                    Total Attrition = SUM(HR[Attrition number]) 
                    Average Age = sum(HR[Age])/sum(HR[Employee Count])
                    Attrition Rate = sum(HR[Attrition number])/sum(HR[Employee Count])
                    Active Employee = SUM(HR[Employee Count])-sum(HR[Attrition number])
